Analysis Correlation and Regression:- -The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is: 0.84 which states that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. This means that as mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well and vise versa. It does not mean that mouse weight causes tumor growth, or vice versa. There may be other factors that influence tumor growth.

Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots:- From Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots, it seems that there are no potential outliers for the Capomulin, Ceftamin and Ramicane regimens, as their respective Series are empty. For Infubinol, there is one potential outlier with a tumor volume of 36.321346, as indicated by the value and the index of the Series. *For this, I worked closely with my bootcamp friend, Veronica.

Bar and Pie Charts:- The bar graph showed the Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum mice number i.e. 230 and Propriva has the minimum mice number i.e. 148 after removing duplicates. From pie chart, the distribution of female versus male mice is 51% male mice and 49% mice.
